Mission Execution Engine for the Rational Behavior Model system for ethical
control of autonomy. See project website at:

positional arguments:
  mission_file_path

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --validate            Warn the user if the mission is dangerously under-
                        specified.
  --exhaustive-testing-max-runs-per-mission EXHAUSTIVE_TESTING_MAX_RUNS_PER_MISSION
                        Sets the exhaustive tester to abort testing a mission
                        after testing a certain number of runs through the
                        mission. This can be useful if your mission is large
                        and would take days, years, or decades to exhaustively
                        test.
  --exhaustively-test   Exhaustively test the selected mission file, using
                        depth-first search to exhaustively run through all
                        possible mission flows.
  --exhaustively-test-all-standard-library-missions
                        Exhaustively test every mission in the standard
                        mission library folder C:\x-nps-gitlab\NetworkOptional
                        Warfare\ethicalcontrol\missions\avcl. If you use this
                        option you should not specify a specific mission
                        filename.
