        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Precept:</b> 
            well-structured mission orders can be syntactically and semantically validated
            to give human commanders confidence that offboard systems
            <em>will do what they are told to do</em>,
            and further
            <em>will not do what they are forbidden to do</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Project Goal:</b> 
            apply Semantic Web ontology to scenario goals and constraints
            for logical validation that human-approved mission orders for robots are
            semantically coherent, precise, unambiguous, and without internal contradictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Long-term Objective:</b>
            demonstrate that no technological limitations exist that prevent
            applying the same kind of ethical constraints on robots and unmanned vehicles that
            already apply to human beings.

            <b>Abstract.</b>
Ethical human supervision of unmanned maritime systems is foundational
in future naval warfare. Forward-deployed unmanned systems in the
human-machine team must comply with their Commander's intent throughout the duration
of their existence in potential future conflicts. Maritime deployment includes harsh physical domains,
long distances from each Commander, and prolonged on-station  time, all of which can significantly stress the capabilities
of the unmanned systems and limit their operator's control. Therefore, in order to
apply ethical control of unmanned systems in future undersea warfare, we develop
an ontology for unmanned systems mission execution and design. This project is studying multiple
canonical missions for unmanned maritime systems, with progressive sophistication, in order
to test and evaluate Ethical Control design on the autonomy of the unmanned systems.
The goals of this research are to ensure unmanned maritime systems comply with
existing policy guidance of the U.S. Department of Defense and relevant international
organizations, further providing inputs to emerging policy guidance. Our vision is for
Commanders to be confident in authorizing life-saving or lethal force from
unmanned systems that operate under ethical control in collaboration with human forces.
Simulation playback of multiple key scenarios demonstrates these principles in action, 
and building a TestDevOps architecture offers potential for establishing virtual/actual testbeds 
to confirm and certify effective robot operations.
Thus, from a broad perspective, Ethical Control enables human teams to perform 
more-effective supervision of operations involving lethal or life-saving force.

                        <i>Symposium workshop overview.</i>
                        The prolific deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across different applications have introduced novel challenges 
                        for AI developers and researchers. AI is permeating decision making for the masses: from self-driving automobiles, 
                        to financial loan approval, to military applications. Ethical decisions have largely been made by humans 
                        with vested interest in, and close temporal and geographical proximity to the decision points. 
                        With AI making decisions, those ethical responsibilities are now being pushed to AI designers 
                        who may be far-removed from how, where, and when the ethical dilemma occurs. 
                        Such systems may deploy global "ethical" rules with unanticipated or unintended local effects or vice versa.
                        While explainability is desirable, it is likely not sufficient for creating "ethical AI", 
                        i.e. machines that can make ethical decisions. These systems will require the 
                        invention of new evaluation techniques around the AI's proficiency and competency in its own ethical reasoning. Using traditional software and system testing methods on ethical AI algorithms may not be feasible because what is considered "ethical" often consists of judgements made within situational contexts. The question of what is ethical has been studied for centuries. This symposium invites interdisciplinary methods for characterizing and measuring ethical decisions as applied to ethical AI.

                               <i>Abstract.</i>
Advances in machine learning are enabling autonomy to operate 
in environments of increasing complexity, including 
scenarios with ethical concerns. For many Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
systems, decisions are driven by the goal to maximize reward. 
Policies may contain unintended consequences 
known as reward hacking. The AI is optimizing within the 
constraints defined by the domain and goals and does not 
have the capability to distinguish between benign and 
negative consequences beyond specifications. This paper 
describes an ongoing effort to develop an application-agnostic
framework for AI systems to simulate actions, characterize 
potential outcomes, and perform introspection to articulate 
the motivations for action. Such a framework provides the 
foundational work for higher-level ethical reasoning using 
consequential and deontological ethics than other approaches
in AI ethics. This enables metrics from consequential ethics 
to be used to assign ethical value of actions based on outcomes. 
Simultaneously, metrics from deontological ethics 
can be applied to evaluate the universality of its motivations.
A Trolley Problem -inspired maritime search-and-rescue scenario 
is used to operationalize and demonstrate this framework.

                               <i>Abstract.</i>
Ensuring ethical robot behavior requires complex representations 
and methodologies designed to guarantee it. Our approach extends 
frameworks already used by the U.S. military
to ensure human ethical and doctrinal behavior by human beings. 
These have built in advantages of being able to express
complex plans and constraints, yet remaining intelligible to
humans, a requirement for ethical responsibility and liability. 
To extend the framework to machines, mission constructs
are expressed using an Autonomous Vehicle Command Language (AVCL) 
expressing mission actions and outcomes that
can readily be translated to runnable source code in several
programming languages. Missions written in AVCL can be
validated via translation to an RDF/OWL Mission Execution
Ontology (MEO) supporting queried proofs of ethical correctness. 
MEO ensures that missions are both semantically
valid and compliant with ethical constraints. These technologies 
implement a simulation, testing, and certification regime
that can serve as a foundation for human authority over and
trust in robots capable of lethal force.

Metrics for AI are important, as illustrated by the workshop topics of interest. We note that 
commonplace gaps in applied AI derive from “Here are the measurements we know how to take” which are too 
easily over-extrapolated into conclusions of interest. In other words, such precise metrics are necessary and 
appealing but may not broadly apply to general situations. We assert that necessary subsequent questions are 
“How do we define meaningful objectives and outcomes for a current unmanned system,” “How do we measure 
those characteristics that indicate expected success/failure,” and “Once we can measure meaningful results, 
how do we assemble exemplars into test suites that confirm successful completion across ongoing system life
cycles?”
                           </p>
                           <p>
This discussion session seeks to find common threads among all workshop contributions that may help advance
progress on these fundamental challenges.

                        Trust can only be achieved if robots can provably follow human orders, both for what to do and what not to do, 
                        over long distances in space and long durations of time.
                        Semantic Web techniques provide a scalable framework for comprehensive progress that can demonstrate compatibility with policy, law, and treaty obligations.
                        Building best-practice workflows for data and metadata from unmanned systems can leverage both field experimentation (FX) and 
                        simulation to support archival data re-use and repeatable analysis.

                        Although many component capabilities can be found today, the overall picture for common practice remains incomplete. 
                        We have achieved useful progress on multiple missing capabilities: 
                        regularization of data-collection workflows by operators of unmanned systems,
                        ability to parse and formally define collected information for re-use, plus
                        ability to replay streams for unit-test assessment and TestDevOps.
                        We are ready to move to the next level: scaling up to archivally support all NPS field experimentation (FX), 
                        establishing an unclassified defense test range useful to all services, industry partners, and allied nations.

        <p>
            The essence of this work is defining missions that are clear, unambiguous, 
            validatable as syntactically correct, and verifiable as logically correct.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Key insights:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                Humans in military units are able to deal with moral challenges without ethical quandaries,
                using formally qualified experience and by following mission orders that
                comply with
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_engagement" target="_blank">Rules of Engagement (ROE)</a>
                and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law" target="_blank">Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC)</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ethical behaviors don't define the mission plan.  Instead, ethical constraints inform the mission plan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Naval forces can only command mission orders that are 
                understandable by (legally culpable) humans, then 
                reliably and safely executed by robots.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Design and development of these capabilities has been ongoing for many years.
            Key language components include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Autonomous Vehicle Command Language</b>
                is an XML-based language for defining unmanned-system missions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>RDF/OWL</b> are standardized Semantic Web languages to express properties and logical relationships.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Terse Triple Language (Turtle)</b> is a concise syntax for RDF/OWL.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>SPARQL</b> is a standardized query language that enables us to write semantic tests.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Life-saving missions and missions with lethal force are complementary.
            Human-robot activity can result in lethal or life-saving outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this work, ethical theory meets professional practice.
            Each step must work for human commanders and unmanned systems alike.
        </p>
        <p>
            Numerous assets are provided here to explain how this approach works and continues to mature.
        </p>

                <a href="https://savage.nps.edu/AuvWorkbench" target="_blank">AUV Workbench</a>
                Demo mode resets each goal's Search type to EXPANDINGSQUARE.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slight change in criteria: reaching the center of the goal is sufficient to declare goal success,
                skipping the actual search.
            </li>
            <li>
                Demo mode thus lets a mission proceed as written in rapid fashion to illustrate decision-tree logic checking.

        <h3>Methodology summary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Read an AVCL mission document
            </li>
            <li>
                Test decision logic using a virtual Software In The Loop (SITL) robot controller, 
            </li>
            <li>
                Run within an evaluation virtual environment (AUV Workbench).
            </li>
            <li>
                Human evaluators then evaluate proper execution of the AVCL ethical mission,
                specifically assessing that robot-controller SITL within the AUV Workbench virtual environment.
