AVCL Schema

TODO
- AVCL/@vehicleName should not be required
- Avcl3ToAvcl2.xslt converter

Fixed
- renamed markElementType to markTargetElementType

Changes
- allow refid and empty content in Goal elements for reusability of goals
- Empty Goal child elements allowed for reusability
- markerType enumerations: acousticPinger, acousticScan, dyeMarker,
	emPinger, emScan, infrared, laser, photograph, smoke, transponder
- add phase attribute to goals
- rename nextOnSucceed to nextOnSuccess
- rename nextOnFail to nextOnFailure

Consider
- additional Goal types
- further definitions of constraints
- further definitions of conditionals
- should initial Goal for mission be explicitly defined, since they can be in any order?  Can there be more than one?

Avoided
- default exception not designated, possibly too prone to catastrophic mission error
  unless fallback protections provided.  For now, diagnose missing exception as part
  of AvclToTurtle.xslt diagnostics.

Mission Execution Ontology (MEO) corresponding to AVCL Schema
- hasNextOnViolate to hasNextOnException (matching AVCL nextOnException)
TODO 
- add Goal property isTerminal (nextOnSuccess, nextOnFailure, nextOnException not defined)
- confusing definition for hasNext, inconsistent with hasNextOnSuccess/Failure/Exception.
  possible alternative is hasPreceding/hasFollowing, but that is likely better for actual execution sequences.
