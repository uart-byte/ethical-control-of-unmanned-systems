### Ethical Control of Unmanned Systems and Robots

**Project Motivation:** ethically constrained control of unmanned systems and robot missions by human supervisors and warfighters.

**Precept:**  well-structured mission orders can be syntactically and semantically validated
to give human commanders confidence that offboard systems
*will do what they are told to do*, and further *will not do what they are told not to do.*

**Project Goal:** apply Semantic Web ontology to scenario goals and constraints
for logical validation that human-approved mission orders for robots are 
semantically coherent, precise, unambiguous, and without internal contradictions.

**Long-term Objective:** demonstrate that no technological limitations exist that prevent
applying the same kind of ethical constraints on robots and unmanned vehicles that
already apply to human beings.

**Abstract.** Ethical human supervision of unmanned maritime systems is foundational
in future undersea warfare. Forward deployed unmanned systems in the
human-machine team must comply with their Commander's intent throughout the duration
of their existence in future Undersea Warfare - in which harsh physical domains,
long distance from the Commander, and prolonged time on-station stress the capabilities
of the unmanned systems and limit their operator's control. Therefore, in order to
apply ethical control of unmanned systems in future undersea warfare, we develop
an ontology for unmanned systems mission execution and design. We study four
canonical missions for unmanned maritime systems with progressive sophistication in order
to test and evaluate Ethical Control design on the autonomy of the unmanned systems.
The goals of our research are to ensure unmanned maritime systems comply with
existing policy guidance of the U.S. Department of Defense and relevant international
organizations, and provide inputs to emerging policy guidance. Our vision is for
Commanders to be confident in authorizing life-saving or lethal force from
unmanned systems that operate under ethical control in collaboration with human forces.
Ultimately, "Ethical Control leads to better warfighting." Simulation playback of
multiple key scenarios demonstrates these principles in action.
