   rdfs:comment    "Abstract
This study identifies the dimensions of autonomous decision-making (DADMs), namely the categories and causes of potential risk that one should consider before transferring decision-making capabilities to an intelligent autonomous system (IAS). The objective of this study was to provide some of the tools needed to implement existing policies with respect to the legal, ethical, and militarily effective use of IAS. These tools help to identify and either mitigate or accept the risks associated with the use of IAS that might result in a negative outcome. The 13 identified DADMs were developed from a comprehensive list of 565 "risk elements" drawn from hundreds of documents authored by parties in favor of, and opposed to, the use of autonomy technology in weapons systems. We record these elements in the form of a question so that they can be used by the acquisition community to develop requirements documents that ensure the ethical use of autonomous systems, and be used by military commanders as a risk assessment checklist to ensure that autonomous systems are not used in an unethical manner. In this way, the Department of Defense can make fully-informed risk assessment decisions before developing or deploying autonomous systems."

   rdfs:comment    "Are all parties (developers, decision-makers, commanders, and operators) using a common and agreed-upon IAS lexicon so as not to inadvertently introduce risk via miscommunication?
As the number of organizations developing IAS grows, the need for common definitions and consistency in the semantics that characterize IAS concepts also grows. The main objective of this DADM is to identify terms that, if misunderstood or miscommunicated, could lead to increased risk in the use of an IAS. It is especially important for all persons involved in the life cycle of an IAS (e.g., designers, developers, operators) to take a consistent approach in defining the terms to prevent risks that can inadvertently result in mishaps. Terms that require particular attention are those that are highly subjective and strongly depend on user interpretation and situational context. Consistency is not only important among the different people involved but also across the different phases of military operations. Having standard semantics and concepts may not completely eliminate risk, but reduces the risk of the operator misusing an IAS because of a miscommunication of the designer's original intention."

   rdfs:comment    "For every point in time during an operation, and for every component that may be used16 during that operation, is there a human who understands how the component functions, is aware of any autonomous functionality within the component, understands the risks associated with its use, and is legally accountable for authorizing its use?
Autonomous functionality can exist in every link of the kill chain, not just at the pinnacle of the decision to apply lethal force. Similarly, autonomous functionality can exist in every precursor activity of a nonlethal autonomous decision aid. Perceived gaps in accountability magnify legal and ethical concerns in the debate on IAS. Ensuring the continuity of legal accountability through every phase of an operation and amongst every interaction between the subcomponents of the overall IAS can help alleviate these concerns."

   rdfs:comment    "Can the degree of autonomous functionality be adjusted to accommodate different or changing degrees of risk tolerance?
The degree of autonomy exists on a spectrum from zero autonomy, in which a human executes all functions, up to full autonomy, in which an IAS executes all functions. Increasing the degree of a system's autonomy can increase the risk of an unintended negative consequence. Additionally, changes in risk tolerance come with changing situations, conditions, and commanders in any dynamic operational environment. Thus, it is advantageous to have the ability to adjust the degree of autonomous functionality to match different risk tolerances, reducing it when risk tolerance is low and increasing it when risk tolerance is high."

   rdfs:comment    "Does use of the IAS impart a military advantage over a non-autonomous alternative system, to include reducing the probability of collateral damage, that justifies accepting the potential risks associated with the use of the IAS?

The role of autonomy is to extend and complement human capabilities, and it is especially valuable in situations that are "dull, dirty, or dangerous." Autonomous functionalities also become necessary when an IAS can perform tasks more effectively, such as decision-making at speeds beyond human capability, and when an IAS can help prevent cognitive overload. Ultimately, the potential risks that come with the use of an IAS are justified if an IAS provides a clear advantage over a non-autonomous alternative system. However, if both perform similarly, then the user may opt to use the non-autonomous system to reduce the risks regarding legal and ethical concerns associated with the use of an IAS (when and if these risks are not also present in the non-autonomous alternative)."

One major concern with IAS is that in some critical circumstances command and control may be difficult or impossible. This DAD seeks to maintain command and control of the IAS to the greatest extent possible and practicable, mitigate against negative consequences when command and control is lost, and minimize but accept the situations where the commander must transfer decision-making capabilities to an IAS. The risk elements under this DAD allow the commander to make a risk-informed decision to transfer decision-making capabilities to an IAS. The commander thus remains accountable for any negative consequences that may result."

IAS use must comply with the LOAC, which requires distinction, proportionality, military necessity, and reducing unnecessary suffering in military operations [30]. LOAC applies to all forms and all instruments of warfare, including IAS. It obliges commanders to consider the presence of certain persons and objects in the operational environment. This DAD addresses specific classes of persons and objects protected from the use of force that use of an IAS must be able to identify and not intentionally harm (in a manner that would violate laws, policies, or the rules of engagement). This DAD specifically does not address the use of IAS that do not use force but can still cause harm, such as an automated or autonomous decision aids.

The purpose of pre-operational audit logs is provenance in the data, software (algorithms), hardware, personnel activities, and processes that are involved in creating an IAS. In order to take action or make a decision, an IAS depends on all of these, but most heavily on the data. Thus, it is critical to ensure that the data are not manipulated, or improperly deleted, and pre-operational audit logs do so by keeping track of authorized users who accesses and processes the data in much the same way as chain of custody is established and maintained in legal proceedings. It is also important to ensure that pre-operational audit logs have detailed descriptions of the origin and trace the development of the algorithms. Pre-operational audit logs also have information on inspecting computer hardware for repairs and modifications. Proper and complete documentation has an important role in establishing a reliable IAS by helping to retain positive control over all aspects of an IAS during its acquisition."

   rdfs:comment    "Does design of the human-machine team (particularly when the use of force is involved) leverage the human’s superior ability to exercise judgment in the use of the IAS in order to reduce the risks associated with its use?

A common theme running through the literature regarding IAS is that the risks of its use come from its inability to adapt, generalize, or put information into a wider context - thus the concepts of "narrow artificial intelligence" [31] and "brittleness" [32]. It is unfortunate then that warfare (and many other application domains where IAS are used) occurs in an unforgiving environment replete with thinking adversaries that actively seek to push enemy commanders out of their tested and preferred concepts of operation and seek to push the technologies they depend on beyond their original design parameters.

One solution to this problem is to put a human operator "back" into or on the loop. This creates a conundrum in that doing so must not reintroduce the negative characteristics of human performance that the IAS was intended to remove in the first place. Human-machine teaming attempts to design system interactions whereby the respective strengths of the human and the machine are retained, and the weaknesses of each are not. IAS weaknesses can introduce additional legal and ethical risks. Human weaknesses can introduce additional operational risk. (18 We do recognize that humans are not legally or ethically infallible.) Therefore, human-machine team designs provide an opportunity to balance legal and ethical risks against operational risks. The objective of this study was to identify and mitigate the legal and ethical risks, but this must be balanced against operational risk. Hence the inclusion of human-machine teaming as a DAD."

   rdfs:comment    "Will/did the IAS test and evaluation procedure reflect the breadth, depth, and complexity of the contemplated operational environment to test and evaluate the system attributes unique to the use of autonomy technologies to the greatest extent practicable?

The potential negative results of systems used by the DOD include unintended deaths. Such high stakes demand an exhaustive approach for test and evaluation to reduce the risk of these negative consequences. Nondeterministic IAS present a situation where the potential configurations are practically infinite in number, negating any attempt to test each and every possible IAS configuration exhaustively in each and every scenario.
Since there is little hope of eliminating all risk, ways must be found to minimize it to the greatest extent possible within the confines of time and funding constraints. Test and evaluation of IAS is further complicated by subjective terminology in the policy documents that mandate it [1, 5].

This DAD aids the development community in the maximization of test and evaluation, and the minimization of risk, to provide a balance between the depth, breadth, and complexity of testing conditions, recognizing that exhaustively testing along all three axes is certainly not practicable and may not be possible."

Initial and continuing training and education prepares developers, operators, and commanders to establish competence in recognizing the characteristics of an IAS that can lead to illegal or unethical use. Also, through training, human operators prepare for situations that require them to be more active and reestablish command and control for safety or security reasons. Training and education also illuminate the limitations of an IAS, the central role of its data and algorithms, and AI-specific failure modes so that the user can clearly understand the IAS technologies and avoid their misuse."

The conditions at the beginning of a long-term mission may change with time. They may also change as the geographic range increases and possibly becomes different from what the IAS design calls for. Thus, initial risk assessments and preprogrammed plans may become invalid by the time an IAS needs to execute its task. Considering an IAS’ performance with respect to time and space is crucial in preventing misconstrued confidence that an IAS will execute its task with appropriate risk. In response to changing risk mitigation conditions and planning factors, it is important that an IAS be able to operate effectively and be equipped to disable autonomous functionalities."

   rdfs:comment    "Have all available measures been taken to ensure that the IAS algorithms and/or machine learning (ML) training data employed in automated and autonomous decision aids do not contain any biases that might incorrectly, disproportionately, or otherwise unfairly affect an individual or a group of persons?

An IAS must be engineered to safeguard human rights - civil rights, which are explicitly codified in law, and natural rights, which are implicitly accepted to be self-evident by most freedom-loving persons and nations. This DAD contains natural rights that some public policy advocacy groups assert should be codified in law to become civil rights.

DOD intends to develop IAS as LAWS for use against enemy combatants, but also as non-lethal autonomous decision aids that can affect enemy combatants, US servicemembers and their dependents, DOD civilian employees, and third parties (including civilian populations). Clearly, each group has different expectations and protections with respect to civil and natural rights. Enemy combatants, for example, are not protected by many of the civil rights listed in this DAD.

A primary (but by no means only) source of risk to human rights infringement is bias. Therefore, IAS developers must be able to recognize algorithms and data that contain biases that will unfairly affect an individual or a group. Initial mitigation of bias in the software itself involves the developers being aware of a large variety of potential bias sources that can bias an IAS’ decisions against a particular individual or group of persons. This includes sources of "analytical" bias that are not inherently biased against any group or person but could become so if not identified and addressed.

Notifications of when an IAS is in use further mitigate the effects of bias, as they bring awareness to the persons affected by the IAS’ actions and decisions. Not all persons enjoy this right to notification. It is clearly not practical to extend this right to suspected criminals in law enforcement or some homeland security applications. This DAD also addresses the bias that occurs when operating in coalition and allied environments, such as bias that stems from different sets of treaties, ROE, or cultural norms. Overall, it is important for all persons involved - the developer, operator, commander, affected person, and oversight specialists - to be vigilant in detecting bias that may result in human rights violations."
